Exporting plots from R can be done in several ways, depending on the desired output format and quality. Here are some common methods to export plots:
1. **Using R's built-in functions**:
   - `png()`, `jpeg()`, `tiff()`, `bmp()`: These functions allow you to save plots in various raster formats. You can specify the filename, width, height, and resolution.
     ```R
     png("plot.png", width=800, height=600)
     plot(x, y)
     dev.off()
     ```
   - `pdf()`: This function saves plots in PDF format, which is vector-based and suitable for high-quality prints.
     ```R
     pdf("plot.pdf", width=8, height=6)
     plot(x, y)
     dev.off()
     ```
   - `svg()`: This function saves plots in SVG format, which is also vector-based and ideal for web use.
     ```R
     svg("plot.svg", width=8, height=6)
     plot(x, y)
     dev.off()
     ```
