# Data Visualization Workshop

**Version:** 0.1.0\
**Status:** Private Launch\
**Maintainer:** Dr. Mukul Maheshwari

## 🔍 Overview

This workshop is a Quarto-powered learning tool that teaches you how to use R to make data visualizations that are easy to understand and based on evidence. It combines basic coding skills, best practices for visual storytelling, and a gallery of plot types, from simple to interactive.

The content is modular, easy for teachers to use, and made to work around real-world limitations. This site supports a thoughtful and hands-on way to talk about data, whether you're teaching, learning, or trying out new things.
